Building a personal blog and career portfolio is an excellent way to apply your BCA Semester 2 knowledge while creating a professional "digital handshake" for the industry. Since you are working a full-time shift from 07:00 to 16:30, this plan is structured into high-impact, modular phases that fit into your early morning and evening windows.

### Phase 1: Architecture & Conceptual Design (Week 1)

Before writing any code, you must define the structure of your site. This prevents "rushing into code," which is a common beginner mistake.

* **Identify Pages:** Plan for a Homepage (Hero section), a Blog (Career lifestyle posts), an Experience section (Working history), and a Collaboration/Booking page.
* **Visual Sketching:** Use pen and paper or a free tool like Figma to draw your layout.
* **Content Gathering:** Prepare your bio, photos for the "lifestyle" aspect, and a list of your professional milestones.

### Phase 2: HTML Structural Building (Week 2)

In this phase, you will focus on the "skeleton" of your website using semantic HTML5 tags. This ensures your site is accessible and organized.

* **Core Structure:** Learn to use `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.
* **Blog Logic:** Practice using `<h1>` to `<h6>` for post titles and `<article>` tags for your blog entries.
* **Collaboration Elements:** Create the structural components for your collaboration page, such as a contact form using `<form>`, `<input>`, and `<textarea>` tags.

### Phase 3: CSS Styling & Aesthetics (Weeks 3–4)

This is where you transform plain text into a professional brand. Focus on layout techniques that make the site look good on both desktops and mobile phones.

* **The Box Model:** Master margins, padding, and borders to create spacing around your experience cards.
* **Layout with Flexbox:** Use Flexbox to align your navigation links horizontally and create a grid for your lifestyle blog images.
* **Typography & Colors:** Choose a consistent 2–3 color palette and readable fonts like Roboto or Lato.
* **Responsive Design:** Use Media Queries (`@media`) to ensure your site remains readable on a smartphone during your commute.

### Phase 4: Appointments & Integration (Week 5)

Managing appointments requires either a complex backend or a smart beginner integration.

* **Booking Forms:** Build a detailed appointment request form where users can select a date and time.
* **No-Code Widgets:** To make your collaboration functional immediately without deep backend knowledge, learn to embed a free booking widget like Calendly or Elfsight. This allows users to see your availability and sync it with a calendar automatically.
* **Social Connectivity:** Add clickable icons linked to your LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.

### Phase 5: Deployment & Documentation (Week 6)

The final step is making your site live so others can see your work.

* **GitHub Hosting:** Since you already have a GitHub repo, learn to use **GitHub Pages**. This is a free service for hosting static HTML/CSS sites.
* **Clean Documentation:** Write a professional `README.md` for your repo explaining the project goals and the technologies you used.

### Learning Schedule for Working Professionals

To maintain consistency while working 07:00–16:30, follow this high-ROI routine :

* **Morning (05:00 - 06:30):** Use this "Deep Logic" time to learn one new concept (e.g., how Flexbox works or how to link a CSS file).


* **Evening (18:30 - 20:30):** Dedicate this block to building. Apply the concept you learned in the morning directly to your website files.


* **Weekends:** Use 4–6 hours for "Synthesis and Review," where you fix bugs and refine your design aesthetics.
